# Buggy Python

## Description
This repository originally contained several buggy python scripts. These are my solutions to the bugs.

## Requirements
This code is written in Python 3 and requires no further installations to run.

## Instructions
We were not allowed to modify the existing logic, just find the bug in the code snippets and correct it.
The expected output when running the script is displayed in `main.py`
In addition we were not allowed to modify the `main.py` file.
